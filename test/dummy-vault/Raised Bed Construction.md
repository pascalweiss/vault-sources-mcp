# Raised Bed Construction

Raised beds offer better drainage, easier weed control, and the ability to fill with high-quality soil regardless of what lies beneath. They are especially useful in areas with compacted clay, contaminated ground, or poor native soil.

## Materials

Cedar and redwood are naturally rot-resistant and last 10-15 years without treatment. Avoid pressure-treated lumber for food gardens, as older formulations contained arsenic. Galvanized steel troughs and stone blocks are durable alternatives that add visual appeal.

## Dimensions

A width of 1.2 meters (4 feet) allows comfortable reach from either side without stepping into the bed. Length is flexible, but 2.4 meters (8 feet) is a practical standard. Height depends on need: 15-30 cm is sufficient for most crops, but 45-60 cm benefits gardeners who prefer less bending.

## Filling the Bed

Use a layered approach. Place coarse material like small branches or straw at the bottom for drainage (this is sometimes called Hugelkultur-lite). Fill the middle with a mix of topsoil and compost. Top off with pure compost or a seed-starting blend. The bed will settle over the first season, so overfill slightly.

## Maintenance

Top-dress with 2-3 cm of compost each spring. Avoid walking on the bed, which compacts the soil. Replace wooden sides as they decompose. In cold climates, raised beds warm up faster in spring, giving you a head start on the season.
