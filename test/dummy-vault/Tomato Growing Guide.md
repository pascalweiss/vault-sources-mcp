# Tomato Growing Guide

Tomatoes are one of the most popular garden crops worldwide. With the right variety and care, even a small garden can produce an abundant harvest from midsummer through the first frost.

## Choosing Varieties

Determinate varieties (like Roma and San Marzano) grow to a fixed height and produce fruit all at once — ideal for canning and sauce-making. Indeterminate varieties (like Cherokee Purple and Sungold) keep growing and producing until frost, giving a steady supply for fresh eating.

## Staking and Support

All tomatoes benefit from support. Determinate types do well with simple cages. Indeterminate types need tall stakes or a string trellis system. Pruning suckers — the shoots that emerge between the main stem and branches — directs energy toward fruit production and improves airflow.

## Watering

Consistent, deep watering is critical. Irregular watering causes blossom end rot, a common disorder where the bottom of the fruit turns black. Water at the base of the plant rather than overhead to reduce foliar disease. Mulching with straw helps retain moisture.

## Common Diseases

Early blight and late blight are fungal diseases that cause leaf spots and fruit rot. Remove affected leaves promptly, avoid overhead watering, and consider copper-based organic sprays as a preventive measure during humid weather.
