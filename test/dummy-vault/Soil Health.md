# Soil Health

Healthy soil is the foundation of a productive garden. It is a living ecosystem teeming with bacteria, fungi, earthworms, and countless microorganisms that break down organic matter and make nutrients available to plant roots.

## pH Testing

Most vegetables prefer a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0). Test your soil with an inexpensive kit from a garden center or send a sample to your local agricultural extension office for a detailed analysis. Lime raises pH; sulfur lowers it. Make adjustments gradually over one or two seasons.

## Amendments

Compost is the universal soil amendment — it improves drainage in clay soils and water retention in sandy soils. Other useful additions include aged manure, worm castings, bone meal (for phosphorus), and greensand (for potassium). Avoid adding fresh manure, which can burn roots and introduce pathogens.

## Cover Crops

Planting a cover crop (also called green manure) in fallow beds protects soil from erosion, suppresses weeds, and adds organic matter when tilled in. Common cover crops include crimson clover, winter rye, and field peas. Clover and peas are legumes that fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil.
