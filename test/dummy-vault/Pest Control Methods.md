# Pest Control Methods

Managing pests without synthetic chemicals is achievable through a combination of prevention, biological controls, and targeted organic treatments. The goal is not to eliminate all insects but to maintain a healthy balance.

## Prevention

Healthy soil grows strong plants that resist pests naturally. Rotate crops each year, clean up debris at season's end, and choose disease-resistant varieties when available. Row covers made of lightweight fabric physically block flying insects like cabbage moths and flea beetles.

## Companion Planting

Certain plant combinations deter pests. Marigolds repel nematodes and whiteflies. Basil planted near tomatoes may reduce aphid populations. Nasturtiums act as a trap crop, drawing aphids away from more valuable vegetables.

## Biological Controls

Encourage beneficial predators: ladybugs eat aphids, lacewing larvae consume soft-bodied insects, and parasitic wasps target caterpillars. Avoid broad-spectrum sprays that kill beneficials along with pests. A small dish of water with pebbles attracts pollinators and predatory insects.

## Organic Treatments

When intervention is needed, start with the least toxic option. Neem oil disrupts insect feeding and reproduction. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) targets caterpillars specifically. Diatomaceous earth deters slugs and crawling insects. Always apply in the evening to minimize harm to pollinators.
