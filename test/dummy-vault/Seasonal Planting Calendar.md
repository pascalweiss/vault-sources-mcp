# Seasonal Planting Calendar

Timing is everything in the garden. Planting too early risks frost damage; planting too late shortens the growing season. This calendar provides general guidance for temperate climates (USDA zones 5-7).

## Early Spring (March - April)

Direct sow cold-hardy crops: peas, spinach, lettuce, radishes, and kale. Start tomato, pepper, and eggplant seeds indoors under grow lights. Prepare beds by adding compost and turning the soil lightly.

## Late Spring (May)

After the last frost date, transplant warm-season seedlings outdoors. Direct sow beans, squash, cucumbers, and corn. Install trellises and supports before plants need them.

## Summer (June - August)

Focus on maintenance: watering, mulching, pest monitoring, and harvesting. Sow a second round of lettuce and radishes in partial shade for a fall harvest. Start brassica seedlings indoors in late July for autumn transplanting.

## Autumn (September - October)

Transplant broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage. Plant garlic cloves for overwintering. Collect fallen leaves for compost. Clean up spent plants to reduce overwintering pest habitat.

## Winter (November - February)

Plan next year's garden layout. Order seeds from catalogs. Maintain compost bins. If you have a cold frame or hoop house, grow cold-tolerant greens like mache, claytonia, and winter lettuce.
