# Composting Basics

Composting transforms kitchen scraps and yard waste into rich, dark humus that improves soil structure and feeds plants naturally. It is one of the simplest and most rewarding practices in gardening.

## The Green-Brown Ratio

Successful composting requires a balance between nitrogen-rich "green" materials (fruit peels, coffee grounds, fresh grass clippings) and carbon-rich "brown" materials (dry leaves, cardboard, straw). A ratio of roughly 3 parts brown to 1 part green by volume works well for most backyard bins.

## Hot vs Cold Composting

Hot composting involves actively managing the pile — turning it every few days and monitoring moisture. Internal temperatures can reach 55-65 degrees Celsius, which kills weed seeds and pathogens. Cold composting is simpler: just pile materials up and wait 6-12 months. The result is the same, it just takes longer.

## Troubleshooting

If the pile smells bad, it is likely too wet or has too much green material. Add dry browns and turn it. If nothing seems to be decomposing, the pile may be too dry or too small to retain heat. Aim for a minimum volume of one cubic meter.
