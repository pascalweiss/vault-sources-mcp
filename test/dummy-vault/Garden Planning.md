# Garden Planning

A well-planned garden saves time, reduces waste, and yields more food throughout the growing season. The key is to start with a clear map of your available space and match it against your climate zone.

## Zone Mapping

Before selecting any plants, determine your USDA hardiness zone. This tells you the average minimum winter temperature and dictates which perennials will survive year to year. Most seed packets and plant labels include zone information.

## Crop Rotation

Rotating crops between beds each year prevents soil depletion and breaks pest cycles. A simple four-bed rotation groups plants by family: legumes, brassicas, nightshades, and root vegetables. Each group moves one bed forward every spring.

## Succession Planting

Instead of planting all your lettuce at once, sow a new row every two weeks. This staggers the harvest so you get a steady supply rather than a single overwhelming glut. The same technique works well for radishes, beans, and cilantro.
