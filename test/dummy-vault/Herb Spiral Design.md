# Herb Spiral Design

An herb spiral is a permaculture technique that creates multiple microclimates in a small footprint. By building a raised spiral mound, you get sunny, dry conditions at the top and shaded, moist conditions at the base — all within a two-meter diameter.

## Construction

Start by laying out a spiral shape with bricks, stones, or stacked logs. The center should be about one meter tall, tapering down to ground level at the outer edge. Fill the interior with layers of coarse gravel (for drainage), then topsoil mixed with compost.

## Planting Layout

Place drought-tolerant Mediterranean herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano near the top. Mid-level zones suit basil, sage, and chives. The base, which stays moister, is perfect for parsley, cilantro, and mint. Keep mint in a buried pot to prevent it from spreading aggressively.

## Maintenance

Herb spirals require minimal upkeep. Harvest regularly to encourage bushy growth. Replace annual herbs like basil and cilantro each season. Top-dress with compost once a year in spring.
